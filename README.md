# SQL Query with NULL Value Handling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to handling `NULL` values in comparison operators.

The `bug.sql` file contains a query that unintentionally excludes rows with `NULL` salaries from the results. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version demonstrating how to correctly handle `NULL` values to ensure accurate query results.

This issue highlights the importance of explicitly addressing `NULL` values in SQL queries to avoid unexpected behavior and data loss.
